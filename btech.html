        <h1>And Just Like That… It’s Over.</h1>

        <p>
            Four years.<br>
            Eight semesters.<br>
            Endless assignments, internals, records, projects, and sleepless nights.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some days began with exhaustion. Some nights ended with tears.  
            There were moments I questioned everything:  
            <em>"Why did I even choose this course?"</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            The fear of the future. The pressure of placements. The constant thought:  
            <em>"Am I really good enough?"</em>  
            It wasn’t easy.  
            It was one of the toughest phases of my life.
        </p>

        <p>
            But college life at Sahrdaya wasn’t a fairytale.  
            It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t always smooth.  
            But it was real. Raw. Life-changing.
        </p>

        <h2>💡 Taking the Leap</h2>
        <p>
            At the start, I didn’t know what to expect.  
            But I knew I didn’t want to be “just a student” attending classes and chasing grades.  
            So, I took a leap.  
            I joined IEEE.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Not to fill my resume.  
            Not to tick a box.  
            But to push myself beyond my comfort zone.  
            To discover who I could become.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through IEEE, I found…<br>
            ✨ Purpose.<br>
            ✨ Growth.<br>
            ✨ Friendships.<br>
            ✨ The thrill of creating something meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
            We bunked classes.  
            We conducted events.  
            We brainstormed ideas.  
            We built memories that will last a lifetime.
        </p>

        <h2>🏫 To Sahrdaya…</h2>
        <p>
            You weren’t always my favorite.  
            I’ve complained about you more times than I can count.  
            But looking back, I realize…  
            You shaped me.  
            You tested me.  
            You frustrated me.  
            And in the end — you transformed me.
        </p>

        <h2>❤️ To Everyone Who Made This Journey Special…</h2>
        <p>
            📖 To the teachers who supported us not just in classrooms, but in labs, corridors, and staff rooms — listening to our complaints and calming our fears.
        </p>
        <p>
            🎓 To the seniors who guided us, and the juniors who looked up to us — you were all part of this story.
        </p>
        <p>
            👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 To my parents — thank you for being my strength when I wanted to give up.
        </p>
        <p>
            🤍 To my friends and loved ones — for seeing me at my lowest, celebrating my highs, and standing by me through it all.
        </p>
        <p>
            🙏 And to God — for carrying me through every tough moment, for giving me strength when I felt weak.
        </p>

        <h2>🌟 This Is Not the End…</h2>
        <p>
            This isn’t just a degree.  
            It’s every tear, every laugh, every fear, every late night, and every lesson.  
            It’s a tribute to everyone who was part of this journey.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you, Sahrdaya.<br>
            Thank you, IEEE.<br>
            Thank you to everyone who made these four years unforgettable.
        </p>
